# inventorytracker_server
The client component of a browser-based inventory management system built off MongoDB, Express, React JS and NodeJS.

This acts as a bare template that can be easily expanded into a prototype system. There should be a decent balance between immediate readability and scalability ( in my opinion anyway) - the client section can be found here: https://github.com/syiin/inventorytracker_client/
